<p>Alberta Climate Records is part of a Master's Thesis project by Christine Clark at the University of Lethbridge. Her research explores methods for designing information visualizations about complex topics like climate change. The visualizations feature a dataset provided by Dr. Stefan W. Kienzle, Associate Professor of Hydrology and GIS at the University of Lethbridge, made up of nearly 5 million observed climate records between 1950 and 2010 for 6,834 locations across Alberta. </p>
<p>Trend and Variable visualizations were created with <a target="_blank" href="http://p5js.org/">p5.js</a></a>, an open source JavaScript Library based on <a href="http://processing.org/ target="_blank"">Processing.</a></p>
